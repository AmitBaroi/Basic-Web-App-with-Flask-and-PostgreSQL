### Webapp description:
- You enter the home (index) page where you see a welcome message.
- Fill in the form of required information.
- Press submit (or Enter on your keyboard).
- If all required information is filled, you will be taken to the confirmation (success) page.
- Each submission record is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
