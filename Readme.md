# Basic Web App with Flask and PostgreSQL

Learning to build a basic web application using Python's [Flask](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/) framework and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)'s 
[video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w25ea_I89iM).

### Webapp description:
- You enter the home (index) page where you see a welcome message.
- Fill in the form of required information.
- Press submit (or Enter on your keyboard).
- If all required information is filled, you will be taken to the confirmation (success) page.
- Each submission record is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- The web app also sends an email notification, with the details of each feedback to me.
